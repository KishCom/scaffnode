An ever changing personal preference Node.js web-app scaffolding.

Use this if you're looking to hit the ground running with a project using Node.js, ExpressJS and some other fairly popular Node.js modules.

To install, make sure you have Node.js (>0.6.3) installed on your system as well as NPM. Make sure your node_modules folder, or the NODE_PATH environment variable are setup properly as well.

There are 3 flavours of Node.js scaffolding:
    
    app.js - The standard setup using: ExpressJS, Swig, Less and Underscore
    
    lite.js - Ultra light weight, all default options accepted. Uses only ExpressJs and optionally underscore

    sio.js - All the bells and whistles version using: ExpressJS, Socket.io (with session support), Swig, Less and Underscore

If your Node.js and NPM are already configured, setup and installation is a breeze:

    # Get dependencies
    sudo npm install -d
    # Start the server
    node app.js
    # Or
    #node lite.js
    # Or
    #node sio.js


OTHER GOOD TO KNOW STUFF:
    - Routes/views are in routes.js - however this isn't even used  in the lite.js version
    - Quick'n'dirty HTTPS support can be found inside of lite.js
    - There is no client-side Socket.io code included yet (coming soon... hopefully... if I remember)
    - The TODO file has things I plan on adding eventually
    - Yes I use 4 space indents not 2. Get over it.
